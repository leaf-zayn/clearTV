The two acted and played roles, and they always worked seamlessly with each other, especially in \"Farewell My Concubine\". Famous in the capital, the two agreed to co-act \"Farewell My Concubine\" for a lifetime. However, the two people's understanding of the relationship between drama and life is fundamentally different. Duan Xiaolou knows that drama is not life, while Cheng Dieyi is a human drama.\n   Duan Xiaolou married the famous prostitute Juxian (Gong Li) when he thought that he should get married and set up a business. Cheng Dieyi found that Juxian was a shameful third party and made Duan Xiaolou a traitor. \"Farewell My Concubine\" gave birth to the battle of love, hatred, and hatred that began to escalate with the changes of the times, eventually leading to tragedy."

The director of the sequel was Rob Marshall, who won the Oscar for best film with \"Chicago\".\nIt is reported that the sequel to \"Happy World\" was written by David Magee, the screenwriter of \"Looking for Fantasy Island\" and \"Fantasy Rafting of Teenage School\", and the story is set 20 years after the 1964 film. The main characters are still Mary Poppins and Banks.\nAs a song and dance film, the music creation of \"Happy Man 2\" is also a top priority. For this reason, Robert Marshall specifically found the music creators of \"Hairspray\" (Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman). This sequel creates original songs and brand new soundtracks."

Although the FBI has been monitoring him for a long time, Carter is very cautious on weekdays and almost isolated from the world, so he has never found evidence of his crime. The FBI learned that Carter liked underground racing very much and was the leader of the local Speed Party. In order to obtain evidence of his crime, Brian (Paul Walker as Paul Walker) who successfully cracked the Los Angeles Coaster car robbery in the previous episode had to find him again.\n　　Brian quickly won Carter's trust with his excellent car skills and criminal activities with the Speed Party and became good friends with him. At the same time, another policewoman, Monica (Eva Mendes), who is also the undercover of the Speed Party, broke into Brian's life, and Brian fell in love with Monica unconsciously. Monika has obtained a lot of Carter's criminal evidence, but the ambiguous relationship between her and Carter is unclear."

Brown, who was exhausted from work all day, had to deal with these troublemakers when he returned home. To this end, Brown has found 16 nanny back and forth, but no one can deal with these ghost elves. To make matters worse, Brown's bossy aunt gave him an ultimatum. If he could not find a mother for the children within a month, he would no longer subsidize their living expenses. If the debt-ridden Brown is not funded by his aunt, he will likely go to jail. At this time, life is in desperation.\n　　 While Brown was desperate, a woman with an extremely ugly appearance appeared in front of his house. The woman told Brown that her name was Nancy McPhee (Emma Thompson), and she recommended herself as a babysitter for the children. McPhee has magical powers, and no matter how the children plan to tease her, they cannot succeed. Children's mischief sometimes even retaliate on themselves. Under McPhee’s careful training, the children became better every day, and Brown’s situation was getting better, and even the face of the magic nanny changed."

They first discovered their superpowers and worked in the CIA with several other mutants. Shaw (Kevin Bacon, Kevin Bacon), the Nazi war-monger who triggered Eric's superpower, has been trying to provoke a nuclear war, and he has managed to provoke the conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union. Eric and Charles have been fighting the mutants of Xiao's men, trying to stop Xiao's conspiracy. Xiao urged the Soviet Union to trigger the Cuban missile crisis. After Charles and Eric learned of the news, the mutants in the Gulf and Xiao's men waged a duel. In the end, Shaw was wiped out by Charles and Eric. However, during this process, Eric was gradually influenced by Shaw’s political views, creating a rift with Charles. Through this war in the Gulf, Eric and Charles finally broke up, and one side became Professor X supporting the peaceful coexistence of humans and mutants; the other side insisted on the view of the rise of mutants by exterminating humans, claiming to be Magneto"
